today i've learned what is configuration management tools ,types of configuation management tool {push based , pull based }
config management is part of operations. what is IAC



on 1/02/23

today we've installed some packages on our local machine which is going to be the ansibel server for the lab practice, so the the link for install ing the packages is  {https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/ } paste this on your browser and then copy the link of package, depending on your os of your vm , mine was rhel 9 so for me the packages was {https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-next-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm} and {https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm}

you can download the packages on your local machines through {wget} command and the install these packages using {yum insatll -y and the rmp you want to install, which you can check using the ls command}  and now  update your machine using the {yum update-y } command. now we to install some dependencies like  the python, python-level, python-pip, openssl, ansible, git.


now to we need to add the private IPs of the nodes in the ansible server so that the ansibel server can know how many nodes are  connected with it. for this we have a defauly file in anibleserver called the {host} location [vi /etc/ansible/hosts]. here you can paste Private  IPs of the nodes,  examlpes are already present in the host file for refrences.  nw edit and save the hosts file.

but this host file dosen't work on its own for this we need to provide it with the root permissions this can done through the configuration file locaion of this file is {vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg} here you'll see some scripts 

here you'll see commented scripts
                                 
                                 #inventory = /etc/ansible/hosts
                                 #sudo-user = root                    

uncomment them, save and exit.


but still the connection between the ansible server and the nodes is not established, you cannot push any codes to the nodes
so instead of given  the root user password you can create an user for the ansibel server and this user password can share with the  employess in the real time, 


so in todays lab  we'll also create  users in our local machine and on the cloud servers {2}  and well perform  task through  this user .




now for the user to perform various tasks we need to give  the users the rights and permissions now after creating the ansible user and now for the most important command is {su - ansible} rememver this for logging into user ansible server.


well right now this ansible user dosen't have the root privelidge, so for this use {visudo} command  inside this file you'll find a line 


root ALL= (ALL) (ALL)


here we need to add 


ansible ALL =(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

save it





perform this task on  all the nodes and the ansibel server.now you need to establesh the connection between the ansible server and the nodes for that {ssh private IP of node} but i'll say permisssion denied, because we havent configure the ssh



go to {vi /etc/ssh/sshd_congig } here uncomment (permitrootlogin) in this file and now do this same thing in the all the nodes and done conection is established between ansible server and nodes  ans we need to restart the ssh for connection to be working properly so for that use command (service sshd restart) do this in the nodes and the ansible server.

the local machine is not working as ansible server, may be because of the update, so i've made the one of  the node as asible server and now well establish the ssh connection between the node and ansible server 

P.S the local machne is not working as a node so i'm remocing it fro the host and might try it with rhel 8

now the connection through ssh was sccessful but the its asking for the passwd every logging time, and thtas a problem cz it'll keep on asking me for the passwd each time i try to push some update to the server, then what?



so the solutio for this is we can generate a key into our ansible server and paste that key on ourb nodes, command (ssh-keygen)
this process is know as establising Trust Relationship , and this is of an equal leavel meaning the root will establish trust relationship with root and ause with user.


 so before making the ssh-keygen make sudure you're loggedin as ansible user in both ansible server and the nodes, 
 
 now the ssh key is been generated to check cd /home/ansible/.ssh
 here you'll see (id_rsa , id_rsa.pub , known_hosts).
 
 
 now to copy the key in the nodes simply use the command (ssh-copy-id ansible@{private ip of your node} and enter.
 
 it'll ask you for the passwd one more time, and thats it now when do ssh cooonection it won't ask for the passwd and now you can push any fie and update to the nodes without any passwd this is the concept of trust relationship.
 
 
 
 and the last topic for today's session is the {Host pattern}.
 
 
 suppose you have 10 nodes connected with your ansible sserver and you want to puch the update on the specific nodes instd of pushing it in al the nodes then what?
 or i need to push updates to a partical groups eg. demo?
 
 so  to check number of nodes coonectied with ansble server (ansible all --list-host)
 for nodes in particular group like demo then use (ansible {groupname} --list-host).
 and if you wish to know the specidic nodes in a partical grop top/bottom use comamnd (ansible host[0] --list-host)
 
 0 for the top node and -1 for the last node.
 we can also add rnge like (ansible[1:4] --list-host)
 
 
 that's  it for today


on 03/02/23

I've tried to installl the ansibel server on our local machines and it was a disaster so, in  the the end i've terminated all the server and and recreate the and perform all the above process againg and again i need to say that i do need lot of practice, i was forgetting most of the steps which was causing the errors

but the it all go so good-night for today.

we well study wwhat are Ad-hok commands, Modules, and Playbooks, and how to execute them






so the basic difference between the Ad-hok commands and Modules is that, there is no idempotency in the Ad-hok commands and it'll keep on override the tasks
thats wy we dont use the Ad-hok commands on the permanenet basis and they are use for the temprary tasks.


and ps I'm using the solar putty and its is much better than the putty cause the connection does not terminate again and again.


spoke too soon the connection here also disconnects but reconnection is faster and more better than the putty.



so to use the ad-hok commands 


[ansible@IP] ansible    demo            -a          "ls"
                    {group-name}  {arguments} {linux command} 
                       



[ansible@IP] ansible demo -a "sudo install httpd -y"


but if dont want to type sudo you can use -b {become} 



like [ansible@IP] ansible demo -ba "yum install httpd -y"


you can also use host pattern for customize the command for the specific nodes


like [ansible@IP] ansible           demo[0]    -a "sudo install httpd -y"
                            {for the 1st node}





and [ansible@IP] ansible      demo[-1]          -a "sudo install httpd -y"
                         {for the last node}





and [ansible@IP] ansible         demo[0:4]        -a "sudo install httpd -y"
                        {for range of server 1-5} 







and as you can see there is no idempodency in Ad-hok commands
